Instructions for using ReadText software:

First, download and extract the file to get the ReadText v2.0 folder.

Note: Before extracting the software, you need to disable your antivirus program, as I programmed this software using the auto-it language.

After extraction, run the ReadText.exe file to start a program window.

After running the .exe file, a logo will appear; just wait until the main window appears.

Once the main window appears, enter your text in the "Enter Text" box. After entering your text, find and tap the tab where there is a combo box to select your desired voice from Sapi5. If you have installed multiple voices in Sapi5, this combo box will retrieve all the voices you have installed. Next, find the "ReadText" button. When you press the "ReadText" button, you will see a box containing the text you just entered.
If you don't want to read, you can press escape to return to the main window.

In the main window, I've added a "my message" button to read the message I sent.

There's also a "listen text" button that lets you listen to the text you've typed. Not only that, it also has features to save text as audio, save text as txt, and retrieve text from your clipboard so you don't need to paste it. You can also allow the application to start with Windows by checking the checkbox if you want.

If you need help, click the menu button to open the help menu. In this menu, you can read instructions, software information, contact me, and there's an exit button for those who can't exit the software. You can also see the contributions section to see who has contributed to the software, and the rules section to read the developer's rules.

A message to everyone:
This is the final version of the software. Thank you all for using my software over the past time. I sincerely apologize to everyone for not achieving the suggestions that some of you have made. I am the developer, but I am not as good a programmer as you might expect.
