Instructions for using ReadText software:
First, you need to download and unzip to get the ReadText v2.0 folder
Note:
Before unzipping the software to use, you need to turn off the virus scanner to use, because I programmed this software with auto it language.
After unzipping, you run the ReadText.exe file to start a program window.
After running the .exe file, a logo will appear, you just wait until the main window appears.
After a main window appears, you enter text in the enter text box. After you enter the text, you find and tab there is a combo box to select the reading voice you want from sapi5. If you install many voices in sapi5, this combo box will get all the voices from sapi5 that you have installed. Next, you find the ReadText button. When you enter the ReadText button, you will see a box containing the text you just entered.
If you don't want to read, you can press escape to return to the main window.
In the main window, I have made a my message button to read the messages I sent.
In addition, there is a listen text button that allows you to listen to the text you have entered.
If you want help, you press the alt key to open the help menu. In this menu, you can read instructions, software information, contact me, there is an exit button for those who cannot exit the software. In addition, you can see the contribution section to know who has contributed to the software, see the rules section to read the developer's rules.
Message to everyone:
This is the final version of the software, thank you everyone for using my software during the past time. I sincerely apologize to everyone because I did not achieve the suggestions that some people have made. I myself am a developer, but I am not a good programmer as you expect.
